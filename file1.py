    In this game you will be tasked with opening the magical chest,
    to open it you will first need to find the key,
    and while you search for them there will be enemy's that will try to stop you.
    You will need to fight these enemy's which will give you some gold and a chance of a new attack,
    which you will be able to use in future encounters, as you progress on you
    will fight stronger and stronger enemy's which will drop stronger attacks for you to use.
